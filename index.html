	<b>Most interesting experience:</b> Far too many to recount. In the past month, I would have to say the most interesting experience I've had was accidentally sneaking into the secure part of Google's Googleplex in San Jose, CA. <br/>
	I was visiting as a tourist, and I saw what I thought were a group of other tourists entering the complex. I simply followed along with them. However after I made it past the gate, I very quickly realised that it was no tour group. It was a group of Google Partners and New Hires! And they all had ID passes! Security closed the gates behind us.<br/> 
	Realizing I was past the point of no return, having inadvertently trespassed into the headquarters of one of the world's biggest companies, I had no choice but to go along with it. I followed the group all the way into the central courtyard, keeping my bag placed strategically across my chest to cover where the ID should have been.<br/> 
	I was a bit panicked by now, since there were several signs that said 'Pass holders only'. My luck ran out, as the group began to file into an auditorium building and they begun to check passes. Fortunately, it was the auditorium closest to the wooded park area. I plotted my escape whilst the guides and the group were distracted, and chose my moment to slip past.<br/>
	Although it was a short walk, it felt excruciatingly long. I could be discovered at any moment. I cleared my mind, and did what life had taught me to do best - pretend you know what you're doing, where you're going, and that you belong. I received a few suspicious glances from Googlers, but I managed to confidently walk my way to the park, where I promptly hid behind a tree and waited until the coast was clear, hailed an uber, and got out of there ASAP.
