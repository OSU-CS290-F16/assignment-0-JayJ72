<h2>Assignment 0</h2>
<p>
	<b>What Challenged Me:</b> I found the publishing to ENGR or ONID webspace to be the most challenging aspect of this assignment, as I am an exchange student and unfamiliar with OSU's internal student systems. I resolved this by posting questions on Flip to get help from fellow students.
<p>
<p>
	<b>What I Learned:</b> I learnt how to use Flip and ENGR Webspace, as well as PuTTY. I already knew how to use Git, Github, and write html.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Which resources were most useful:</b> Piazza was extremely helpful, as the other students who were familiar with OSU's student systems could directly help me at all hours of the day.
